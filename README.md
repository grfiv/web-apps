# Standards-based web applications

Based on the book [A Software Engineer Learns HTML5 JavaScript & jQuery](http://cisdal.com/publishing.html)

This is a pseudo git submodule, a repo within (a subdirectory of) another repo: it is under the ```web-apps``` directory of the GitHub repo [george-fisher](https://github.com/grfiv/georgefisher); the containing repo's ```.gitignore``` contains an entry for ```web-apps/```    

This website can be accessed by [http://georgefisher.com/web-apps/tasks.html](http://georgefisher.com/web-apps/tasks/html), showing increasing functionality as I progress through the book.

*   Tested with Apache/2.4.18 running on Ubuntu 16.10 Desktop   
*   The IDE alternated between ```vim 7.4.1829```, ```PhpStorm 2016.2.1``` and ```Geany 1.28```

*   ```.htaccess``` rewrites ```.htm``` to ```.html``` so either can be used by a client; all ```html``` files must be named ```*.html``` on the disk in order to be accessable from the web.
